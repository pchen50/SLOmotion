## Project Description
We have decided to create a Movie Watch List Tracker that allows users to create, manage, and share a personalized list of movies. Users will be able to add new movies, mark them as **“want to watch”**, **“currently watching”**, or **“watched”**, and include optional details like personal ratings, genres, or notes. Users can then also filter their movie list based on their watch status and optional details. The backend API will use a relational database (Postgres) to store users and movie lists. This is ideal for users who want a flexible way to find and track the movies they watch.
