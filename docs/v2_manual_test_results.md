## 2. Watchlist User Looks for a Movie to Watch Example Flow
Alice finishes watching *Barbie* and updates its status in her watchlist. She then checks Bob's watchlist and finally gets new recommendations for herself.

- Alice calls `PATCH /watchlist/456219/tt1517268`
  ```json
  {
    "user_id": "456219",
    "movie_id": "tt1517268",
    "status": "watched",
    "rating": 8
  }
  ```
- Server response:
  ```json
  { "message": "Successfully updated!" }
  ```
- Alice calls `GET /watchlist/876543/watched`
  ```json
  {
    "user_id": "876543",
    "status": "watched"
  }
  ```
- Server response:
 ```json
 [
   {
      "movie_id": "tt1517268",
      "title": "Gladiator",
      "status": "watched",
      "rating": "9.8",
      "genre": "action"
    },
    {
      "movie_id": "tt1417298",
      "title": "Good Will Hunting",
      "status": "watched",
      "rating": "9.7",
      "genre": "drama"
    }
 ]
``` 
- She then calls `GET /recommended_movies/456219` to receive personalized recommendations.

To check Bob's watchlist she calls `GET /watchlist/5/watched` since Bob's user_id is 5.

curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://slomotion.onrender.com/watchlist/5/watched' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'access_token: SLOmotion44'

Server response:
  ```json
  [
    {
      "movie_id": 6,
      "name": "The Dark Knight",
      "genre": "Action"
    },
    {
      "movie_id": 10,
      "name": "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King",
      "genre": "Action"
    },
    {
      "movie_id": 12,
      "name": "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring",

  ]
  ```

      },
      {
        "movie_id": 28,
        "name": "Interstellar",
        "genre": "Adventure"
      },
      {
        "movie_id": 33,
        "name": "Back to the Future",
        "genre": "Adventure"
      },
      {
        "movie_id": 74,
        "name": "Inglourious Basterds",
        "genre": "Adventure"
      },
      {
        "movie_id": 94,
        "name": "2001: A Space Odyssey",
        "genre": "Adventure"
      }
    ]
  
  ```
- The server returns 5 movies from the genre Adventure, which is tied for the most common in Joeâ€™s watchlist. Since Adventure appears first when counts are tied (alphabetical or order by default), those recommendations are selected.
