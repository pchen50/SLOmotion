# Example Work Flow 
## Watchlist User Makes a Comment Example Flow
Bob just finished watching *Good Will Hunting* for a second time and had some thoughts about the movie. He wants to leave a comment on his friend Joe's watchlist.

- Bob calls `GET /watchlist/876543` to see Joeâ€™s recently watched list.
- He sees *Good Will Hunting* under `movie_id tt1417298`.
- He then calls `GET /watchlist/876543/tt1417298` to view the movie entry.
- Bob submits a comment with:
  ```json
  {
    "comment": "I really connected with the character Will in the movie."
  }
  ```
- Request: `POST /watchlist/876543/tt1417298/1391810/comment`
- Server response:
  ```json
  { "message": "Comment added." }
  ```
